      <p>Q2)Write about console screen. And why it is use. And how to open console screen and how to print anything on console?
        <br>
        Ans2) You could right-click on the webpage and click "Inspect," and the developers window will appear. Click the "Console" tab in that window.
        You should use the console. log() method to print to console JavaScript. The JavaScript console log function is mainly used for code debugging as it makes the JavaScript print the output to the console. To open the browser console, right-click on the page and select Inspect, and then click Console.
